# AllCash

> I came up with this idea as I was getting my dad to switch to open source tools to save money. I tried finding an open alternative to EveryDollar, and it stumped me. EveryDollar has so many users, yet there isn't even an open web-based budgeting app, let alone one that supports connecting with banking apps and/or receipts. **It is for this reason that I decided to make *AllCash*, the open source budgetting app to help you put all of your cash to work.**
